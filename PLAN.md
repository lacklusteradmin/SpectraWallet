# Core-first migration plan

Spectra's iOS app was built before its Rust core. This document states the
architecture the project is moving to, why, what still stands in the way, and
the order the work happens in.

It is the plan of record. When it disagrees with `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, this
file describes the destination and that file describes the present.

---

## The target

```
core/   the program: domain state, domain rules, persistence, network, crypto
cli/    a full front end, and the check that core needs no platform
swift/  a shell: renders what core says, forwards what the user does
kotlin/ the same shell, later
```

Three properties define "done":

1. **Core owns the domain state.** Wallets, transactions, settings, selected
   wallet, send draft — one copy, in Rust, persisted by Rust. No platform holds
   a second copy it considers authoritative.
2. **Core owns the decisions.** A front end sends an intent ("send this
   amount", "select this wallet"); core validates it, updates its own state,
   and returns the new state. There is no step where core computes advice and a
   front end applies it to state the front end owns.
3. **The CLI can do everything the app can.** Not because the CLI needs feature
   parity as a product, but because anything it *cannot* reach is logic still
   trapped in the app.

## The line: domain state vs view state

"The UI is just a shell" is right in spirit and wrong if taken literally.
Pushing *view* state into Rust produces a worse app — every keystroke round
trips the FFI, latency shows, and it fights SwiftUI's rendering model. Shared
core projects usually fail here, not at the domain layer.

| Belongs in `core/` | Belongs in the shell |
|---|---|
| Which wallets exist, their addresses and balances | Which screen is showing, whether a sheet is open |
| Whether an address is valid for a chain | The half-typed string in the text field |
| Whether a send is allowed, and its fee | Scroll position, focus, animation, haptics |
| Transaction history and its pagination cursors | List row identity and diffing |
| Persistence and its schema | Locale-driven text layout, Dynamic Type |
| Network calls, retries, endpoint selection | Keychain, biometrics, notifications, Live Activities |
| Chain facts: derivation paths, EVM membership, address formats | Colors, icons, Liquid Glass materials |

Rule of thumb: if losing it on app restart would be a **bug**, it is domain
state. If losing it is **fine**, it is view state.

The platform still owns things Rust genuinely cannot reach — Keychain,
biometrics, `UNUserNotificationCenter`, `ActivityKit`, battery and network
signals. Those stay in Swift and feed *inputs* to core-owned policy, which is
already how `SecretStore` and `MaintenanceStore` work.

## Where the project actually is

Measured, not estimated:

| | |
|---|---|
| Swift, non-generated, excluding tests | 30,879 lines |
| — `views/` + `extensions/` (genuine UI) | 11,113 lines (36%) |
| — root of `swift/` (`AppState`, stores, persistence, bridges) | 19,766 lines (64%) |
| `core_plan_*` FFI exports (core advises, Swift applies) | 42 |
| Swift calls to `StateCommand` / `reduce_state_in_place` | 0 |

The third and fourth rows are the same fact stated twice. Rust has a state
reducer; Swift has never called it. `swift/AppState+CoreStateStore.swift` says
so in a comment: *"Swift's `@Observable` arrays on AppState are the canonical
store … There is no Rust round-trip."*

That is the debt. It is not "some coupling" — it is that the app is the owner
and the core is a library of helpers shaped by whatever the app needed that
day.

### What is already done

Groundwork from earlier passes, none of which changes ownership but all of
which is a prerequisite:

- `SecretStore` has native Rust implementations (`InMemorySecretStore`,
  `FileSecretStore`), so secret-bearing paths run without a device.
- `wallet_db` persists `CoreAppState` — the Rust state model finally has a home
  on disk.
- The CLI dropped its own wallet model and secret store; it drives
  `store::state` and `wallet_db` directly.
- Every wide per-chain record is now keyed by `registry::Chain` rather than
  carrying one field per chain.
- Per-chain facts (address format, EVM membership, derivation paths, address
  slots) live on `registry::Chain` instead of being re-tabulated per module.

That work removed the *duplication* symptom and fixed five real bugs on the
way. It did not touch the *ownership* problem, which is what the rest of this
plan is about.

---

## The stages

Each stage ends with the app building, the Swift and Rust test suites passing,
and the CLI able to exercise what moved. Stages are ordered by dependency, and
each one is separately shippable.

### Stage 0 — Prove the pattern on something small — **done**

Display currency (`AppSettings.fiat_currency_code`) moved end to end. The
feature was never the point; the mechanics were, and they are now settled:

**The shape every later stage copies.**

```
front end                 core
  │                        │
  ├─ open_state(db) ──────►│  load from wallet_db, hold it
  │◄──── CoreAppState ─────┤  the caller's initial snapshot
  │                        │
  ├─ apply_state_command ─►│  reduce_state_in_place
  │                        │  persist, if anything changed
  │◄──── StateTransition ──┤  new state + events
  │                        │
  └─ render the state, react to the events
```

- `WalletService` owns `CoreAppState` and a bound db path. `apply_state_command`
  persists before returning, so **no caller can forget to save** — the way two
  copies of the truth start diverging.
- A command that changes nothing returns **no events and writes nothing**. Front
  ends use that to avoid pointless follow-on work: Swift only refetches fiat
  rates when a `fiatCurrencyChanged` event actually appears.
- Swift keeps a `private(set)` mirror with exactly **one** writer
  (`applyCoreSettings`). `selectedFiatCurrency` is computed over it: reading is
  free, assigning sends a command. Views bind to it unchanged.
- The CLI opens the service fresh per command. A short-lived process that
  reopens cannot overwrite the store with a stale snapshot.

**Verified end to end:** `spectra` sets CHF → the exact call the app makes
(`WalletService::open_state`) reads CHF back from the same database. Swift no
longer stores the setting anywhere: the `UserDefaults` key is gone, the
`PersistedAppSettings` field now reads the mirror, and one stored property
replaced three storage paths.

Also settled by doing it: `AppSettings` had three fields, all dead. It now
carries one, with a rule in its doc comment — a field belongs there only if
every front end must agree on it and losing it on restart would be a bug.

### Stage 1 — Move the domain state — **done**

Wallets, transactions, address book. The large one.

- `CoreAppState` becomes the single source of truth.
- `AppState`'s `wallets` / `transactions` / `addressBook` become projections of
  a Rust snapshot, not stored arrays.
- `PersistenceStore.swift` retires; `wallet_db` already has the tables.
- `CoreImportedWallet` — a Rust record with no Rust behaviour, mirroring a
  Swift type — is deleted in favour of `WalletSummary`.

This is where the app is most at risk of regressions, and where the CLI earns
its keep: every operation should be reachable from `spectra` first.

| Collection | State |
|---|---|
| Address book | **done** |
| Transactions | **done** |
| Wallets | **done** — core owns the list; `CoreImportedWallet` demoted to a view model |

**Transactions do not belong in `CoreAppState`.** Investigating them surfaced a
limit in the Stage 0 shape: `apply_state_command` returns the whole state, which
is fine for bounded collections (settings, address book, a few dozen wallets)
and wrong for an unbounded one. Every `SetFiatCurrency` would clone the entire
transaction history.

So transactions get their own core-owned surface rather than a `CoreAppState`
field — which is the correct modelling anyway. `CoreAppState` is *the small,
always-resident domain state*; history is a queryable store. The pieces already
exist: the `history_records` table, `history_upsert_batch` / `history_fetch_all`,
`core_merge_transactions`, and the pagination cursors in
`fetch/history_store.rs`. What is missing is ownership — Swift still decides
when to write, via `persistTransactionsDelta`.

The shape, now built (step 1 of 4):

- ✅ `WalletService::apply_transaction_command` / `transactions()` /
  `transactions_for_wallet()`, backed by `history_records` and the db path
  bound by `open_state`. Not `StateCommand` — that is for the resident state.
- ✅ A command returns `TransactionChange { added, updated, removed }` — **ids,
  not records**. Core computes that delta by consulting the store, because
  whether a record is new is a property of the store, not something a caller
  can know. Swift's `persistTransactionsDelta` guessed at it.
- ✅ `AppState.transactions` is `private(set)` with one writer
  (`setTransactionProjection`). Mutations go through `recordTransactions` /
  `removeTransactions` / `clearAllTransactions`, which update the projection
  and send the command.
- ✅ `persistTransactionsDelta`, `persistTransactionsFullSync` and
  `historyRecordsTyped` deleted. Nothing in Swift writes history any more.
- ✅ Background refresh writes through `TransactionCommand::Merge`. Core reads
  its own records to merge against, so **only the incoming page crosses the
  FFI**; previously the entire history went out, came back merged, and the
  changed subset went out again — three crossings of the whole list per refresh.
  Core writes only records the merge actually altered, so a refresh that returns
  what is already stored writes nothing.

The wire ↔ persisted record conversion moved into core with it
(`fetch/transactions.rs`). Both platforms used to own it; it is 30 fields with
three subtleties — `kind`/`status` are strings on the wire and enums in storage,
and the timestamp changes epoch — and a round-trip test now pins it.

That also deleted the caller-side diff this stage previously needed:
`setTransactionsIfChanged` and `transactionSnapshotsMatch` are gone. Once core
merges against its own store, nothing on the Swift side has to work out what
changed.

Two things moved into core along the way, both previously done in Swift on
every write: deriving the indexed columns from a record, and the **Swift
reference date → Unix epoch conversion** for `created_at`. That conversion is
the trap `FFI-BOUNDARY.md` warns about; getting it wrong misorders history by
31 years, and it no longer sits on the boundary.

Still open before wallets: **how a core-owned collection interacts with
background refresh**, which writes in bulk from the balance/history engine.
Wallets have the same problem plus key material.

**Address book — what moved, and what it settled.**

The list, its ordering, and the rules about what may go in it are core's. Swift
holds a mirror with one writer and sends `AddAddressBookEntry` /
`RenameAddressBookEntry` / `RemoveAddressBookEntry`.

- **Validation moved with the data.** Trimming, address normalization, chain
  validity and the duplicate check were four Swift functions; they are now
  reducer rules. A front end cannot save a duplicate by forgetting to check.
- **Refusals are reported, not silent.** A rejected command returns an
  `addressBookRejected` event carrying an `AddressBookRejection` reason. Both
  front ends map that to their own wording — the CLI prints it, Swift shows
  `addressBookError`. This is the pattern for any command that can be refused.
- **The Swift `AddressBookEntry` struct is gone**, replaced by the Rust record.
  One model, not two. Its `id` became a `String`: an opaque core-assigned
  identifier, not something the platform mints.
- **Three storage paths collapsed to one.** The `@Observable` array, the
  `UserDefaults` key and the `CorePersistedAddressBookStore` KV blob are all
  replaced by the `address_book` table.

**Done when:** `AppState` stores no domain collections, and no second
authority persists them. Both hold: the three collections are projections, and
`PersistenceStore.swift` keeps only non-domain caches (live prices, token
preferences, keypool snapshots) that later stages move.

**Wallets — the model is unified; the app has not moved yet.**

`WalletSummary` is now able to represent everything the app's record holds, and
`CoreImportedWallet::to_summary` converts between them. The conversion is
**deliberately asymmetric**, and that asymmetry is the finding:

- `CoreImportedWallet` carries the whole 45-entry derivation-path table and both
  network-mode fields on *every* wallet, though a wallet belongs to one chain
  and uses one path on one network. The summary keeps the entry that wallet
  actually uses; the other 44 are global defaults, not per-wallet data. Twenty
  wallets no longer mean twenty copies of the same table.
- `CoreCoin::id` does not survive. It is a SwiftUI `Identifiable` key — view
  state that leaked into the domain record — so `AssetHolding` has no id and the
  projection mints one.
- `is_watch_only` cannot be read off the app's record at all: iOS derives it
  from whether the Keychain holds signing material. The caller states it.

**What moved.** `AppState.wallets` is a projection of `CoreAppState.wallets`,
rendered through `WalletSummary::to_imported_wallet`. Every mutation is a
`StateCommand`, and the Keychain-backed `PersistedWalletStore` — the second
authority — is deleted along with `persistWallets`, `loadPersistedWallets`,
`storedWalletIDs`, `sanitizedWallet` and the `PersistedWallet` record.

Unlike transactions, **wallet writes are awaitable**. They are rare, and a
caller that must know the wallet is durably stored before continuing — import,
above all — has to be able to wait. Only the synchronous UI entry points defer.

`CoreImportedWallet` survives as the shape the views render, demoted from
authority to view model. Retyping the ~1,000 Swift references to `WalletSummary`
is a separate cleanup, not an ownership question.

Three real bugs surfaced by doing this, each now regression-tested:

- **Resolving a derivation path for any testnet crashed the app.** Testnets
  carry `derivation_path = []` in the catalog — they derive from their mainnet's
  path — but `default_path_from_catalog` did not apply that rule, and the iOS
  caller turns the failure into a `fatalError`.
- **A deleted wallet could come back.** A balance refresh that lands after the
  deletion upserted it again. Balance refresh now uses
  `UpdateWalletIfPresent`, which updates and never creates.
- **A second `open_state` reverted newer writes.** It replaced the in-memory
  state with a snapshot from the database, so the launch reload racing a user
  action silently undid it. Opening is idempotent now.

### Stage 2 — Move the decisions — **done** (42 → 10)

Replace the 42 `core_plan_*` exports with intents.

Done so far:

- Deleted 5 planners with no caller on either side, plus `send/utxo.rs` — a
  second, unreachable UTXO selection implementation that shadowed the live one
  in `send/chains/bitcoin.rs`.
- Moved the confirmation-poll backoff table into `WalletService`. It had been
  the pattern in miniature: core computed the next tracker state, Swift stored
  it in `statusTrackingByTransactionID` and passed it back on the next call.
  Five planners collapsed into seven intents, and the Swift mirror type
  (`TransactionStatusTrackingState` plus its two conversions) is gone.
- Deleted the unreachable Swift half of the receive-sheet selection.
  `corePlanReceiveSelection` cannot return nil, so the hand-written Swift
  fallback under `if let plan = ...` had never once run — a second copy of the
  rule, kept only because the wrapper's return type said `?`.
- Converted `core_plan_wallet_import` into `WalletService::import_wallets`.
  Core now plans, builds and stores the wallets in one call; the caller gets
  back what was created plus the Keychain instructions, which stay on the
  platform side because a keystore is platform, not domain. Deleted
  `walletForSingleChain` and `walletForPlannedImport` — Swift's hand-written
  copy of the wallet constructor.
- Deleted three dead UserDefaults readers. Keypool state, owned addresses and
  operational events each moved to SQLite at some point, but startup still
  seeded them from the old `*.snapshot.v1` UserDefaults keys first. Nothing has
  written those keys since the move, so the seed could only ever supply stale
  data — and keypool indices going stale means address reuse. The SQLite load
  that followed was guarded by `!isEmpty`, which hid it: core's value won
  whenever core had one. Those guards are gone too, so an emptied keypool now
  clears instead of silently keeping the previous value.
- Split reading keypool state from recording it. `keypoolState` wrote on every
  call, and `chainKeypoolByChain` is observed, so the diagnostics screen was
  mutating observed state from inside a SwiftUI `body` — via `keypoolState` and
  again via `reservedReceiveAddress`, which records an owned address even when
  asked not to reserve. Added `keypoolStateForDisplay` and
  `reservedReceiveAddressForDisplay`; reporting state no longer changes it.

- Moved the keypool into core. `chainKeypoolByChain`, its `didSet`, and
  `persistKeypoolToRust` / `persistChainKeypoolState` / `persistKeypoolForChain`
  are all deleted; `WalletService` holds the table, loads it in `open_state`,
  and writes through to `wallet_keypool` before returning.

  The point was atomicity, not tidiness. Reserving an index is
  read-modify-write, and it used to run as read → compute in Swift → detached
  `Task` to persist. Two reservations racing there hand the same receive
  address to two people. `reserve_receive_index` / `reserve_change_index` now
  hold one write lock across the whole operation; a 32-way concurrent test
  asserts every index comes back exactly once.

  Fallout worth remembering: `syncChainOwnedAddressManagementState` *reserves*
  indices, and it ran in the synchronous startup path — before core had loaded
  the keypool. It would have reserved against an empty table and reissued
  addresses on every launch. It now runs after `open_state`.
  `delete_keypool_for_wallet` / `_for_chain` also clear the in-memory rows, not
  just the stored ones.

Today: `core_plan_receive_selection(...)` returns advice, Swift applies it to
Swift-owned state. After Stage 1 there is no Swift-owned state to apply it to,
so most of these collapse into ordinary state transitions inside core and
simply disappear from the FFI.

Expect the FFI surface to *shrink*, not grow. A planner that survives is a sign
the state behind it did not actually move.

Surveying the remaining 32 by what their result actually feeds, they are not
one problem but three:

1. **Pure calculations, misnamed.** `core_plan_icon_identifier`,
   `core_plan_canonical_chain_component`, the two Ethereum field validators,
   `core_plan_ethereum_send_error_code`. No state behind them at all. These
   should keep their place on the FFI and lose the `plan_` prefix — but
   renaming is not converting, so do it last and do not let it flatter the
   count.
2. **Calculations over *view* state.** `core_plan_receive_selection` reads
   `receiveChainName` — which chain the receive sheet is showing. By rule 4
   that is view state and correctly stays in Swift. Same shape as group 1.
3. **Genuine planners over domain state.** `core_plan_wallet_import` is the
   clearest: core decides which wallets to create, Swift builds them and calls
   `recordWallets`. Since Stage 1 put wallets in core, that round trip should
   become `service.import_wallets(...)` with the wallets landing directly in
   core. Keychain writes stay in Swift — they are platform, not domain.

`core_plan_store_derived_state` and `core_plan_transfer_availability` sit
between 2 and 3: they return holding *indices* that Swift resolves back into
`Coin`s, purely because the resolving code lives in Swift. They are Stage 3
work — they disappear when `StorePersistenceNormalization` moves into core.

**Done when:** every remaining `core_plan_*` is a planner over state that has
not moved yet — not merely a function whose name starts with `core_plan_`.

The original wording ("under 10") counted the prefix, not the shape, and those
are different things. Roughly twenty of the exports were never planners at all:
`core_icon_identifier` builds a string, `core_ethereum_send_error_code`
classifies a message. They hold no state, they were correctly placed on the
FFI, and they only looked like debt because of the name. They have been renamed
to drop the prefix — a naming fix, and worth saying plainly that it is not a
conversion.

**Stage 2 is complete.** 42 → 10. The ten survivors are all genuine planners
whose state Stage 3 moves: `store_derived_state` and `transfer_availability`
(derived caches in `StorePersistenceNormalization`), the two keypool baselines
(they read the Swift-held owned-address table), the dashboard and token
preference trio, `price_alert_evaluation`, `append_chain_operational_event`,
and `reset_dispatch`. Converting them before their state moves would just
relocate the round trip.

### Stage 3 — Thin the shell

With state and decisions in core, most of the 19,766 lines at the root of
`swift/` are either dead or belong in Rust:

- `StoreHistoryRefresh`, `StorePersistenceNormalization`,
  `StoreDiagnosticsExport`, `DashboardStore` — move to core.
- `Store+Formatting` is the exception, and the earlier draft of this list was
  wrong to include it wholesale. Which decimals an asset shows and what
  currency a value is in are domain; turning a number into text with
  `NumberFormatter` is locale-aware platform work that Rust would only
  reimplement worse. Move the rules, leave the rendering.

Done so far:

- **Pinned dashboard assets → `AppSettings`.** They were a Swift array kept in
  `cachedPinnedDashboardAssetSymbols`, persisted through a second settings
  blob, and seeded at launch from a UserDefaults key that had no writer left.
  Core normalises (upper-case, de-duplicate, keep pin order) and stores them.
- **Tracked tokens → `CoreAppState.token_preferences`.** The clamping rule —
  a token cannot display more decimal places than it has — moved with them, so
  it is enforced once rather than at each Swift mutation site. Loading them
  from a separate SQLite blob is gone; they arrive with the rest of the state.

  Adding those two fields broke every launch on an existing database
  ("missing field `pinnedDashboardAssetSymbols`") because the stored JSON
  predates them. `#[serde(default)]` fixes it, and
  `settings_forward_compatibility` now pins that down — extending a stored
  struct must not make what is already written unreadable.

- **Transaction merge strategy → `registry::Chain`.** Eighteen Swift wrappers
  (`upsertBitcoinTransactions`, `upsertSolanaTransactions`, …) each named a
  chain and the merge strategy to use with it. That is a per-chain fact stated
  eighteen times in the shell — rule 2, and precisely the thing that makes
  adding a chain a Swift change. They collapse into one
  `upsertTransactions(_:chainName:)`; `TransactionCommand::Merge` no longer
  takes `strategy` or `include_symbol_in_identity` at all, because core reads
  both off the chain.

  `refreshNormalizedChainTransactions` also took an `upsert` closure *and* a
  `chainName`, so callers had to supply a matching pair. The closure is gone;
  the helper uses the chain name it already has.

  Writing the mapping by hand reproduced the original bug in miniature:
  `zcash-testnet` fell through to account-based because only `Chain::Zcash` was
  listed. It now resolves through `mainnet_counterpart()`, and
  `a_testnet_merges_the_same_way_as_its_mainnet` fails if any testnet ever
  diverges again.

- **EVM native assets → `registry::Chain::coin_symbol()`.** `supportedEVMToken`
  excluded a chain's native asset with six hand-written chain/symbol pairs
  (`"Ethereum"`/`"ETH"`, `"Avalanche"`/`"AVAX"`, …) against 23 EVM mainnets.
  It asks the registry now. Worth being precise: this was *not* a live bug —
  an unlisted native asset fell through to a token lookup that also missed, so
  the answer came out the same. It was a partial copy of a complete table,
  which is how the next one becomes a bug.

- **Send gating → `registry::Chain::send_rule()`.** `can_send_holding` matched
  on chain-name strings in core. Now a `SendRule` on the chain, resolved
  through `mainnet_counterpart()` so testnets cannot diverge.

  Moving it exposed an asymmetry worth a decision rather than a silent fix:
  Ethereum, BNB Chain and Avalanche require a non-native asset to be a
  supported token before offering send; every other EVM chain falls through to
  no restriction. So an unsupported token on Arbitrum or Base would be offered
  for sending and fail at submit, where the same token on Ethereum would not be
  offered. Behaviour was preserved exactly — `send_rule_asymmetry_across_evm_chains`
  pins the current list and fails if it changes, so the question stays visible
  instead of being decided by accident.

**Next unit, and why it did not happen in this pass.** `core_plan_store_derived_state`
and `core_plan_transfer_availability` still return holding *indices* that Swift
resolves back into `Coin`s. The indirection exists because `WalletSummary`
drops `CoreCoin::id`, so core cannot hand back a renderable coin from the
authoritative record. Removing it means a `wallet_derived_state()` on the
service that builds its request from core's own wallets and returns resolved
coins. Everything it needs is already core-side — `supportsSend`,
`supportsReceiveAddress` and `liveChainNames` come from the catalog bridge
today — except the Keychain lookups (`has_signing_material`,
`is_private_key_backed`), which stay platform and get passed in. That is a
single coherent change to portfolio totals and send/receive availability, and
it wants a whole pass rather than the tail of one.
- `AppState+*` extensions shrink to event forwarding.
- Bridges (`WalletServiceBridge`, `CachedCoreHelpers`) shrink as the surface
  they wrap shrinks.

**Done when:** the root of `swift/` is a minority of the Swift line count, and
adding a chain requires no Swift change at all. Currently 19,811 root vs
10,969 in `views/` — the number that has to invert.

### Stage 4 — Android

Only meaningful once the above holds. If Kotlin can be brought up against the
same core without discovering new iOS assumptions, the migration worked.

---

## How progress is measured

Not by feel. These four numbers, checked at the end of each stage:

| Metric | Start | Now | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core_plan_*` exports | 42 | 10 | 10, all Stage 3 |
| Swift root lines vs `views/` | 19,766 vs 11,113 | 19,800 vs 11,113 | inverted |
| Domain collections stored on `AppState` | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| Domain settings owned by core | 0 | 1 | all |
| Wallet operations reachable from the CLI | partial | partial | all |

Stage 0 built the mechanism and moved nothing, so the Swift count went *up*.
The address book is the first collection to actually move; the count starts
coming down as the paths it replaced are deleted.

## Rules for new work while this is in progress

1. New domain logic goes in `core/`. If it cannot be driven from the CLI, it is
   in the wrong place.
2. New per-chain facts go on `registry::Chain`, not in a `match` in whichever
   module needs them.
3. Do not add a `core_plan_*`. If core needs to decide something, it should own
   the state it decides about.
4. Swift may hold view state freely. It may not hold domain state.
5. Prefer deleting a Swift file over porting it. Much of the root of `swift/`
   exists only to reconcile two copies of the truth; with one copy it is not
   needed.

## Known open items

Carried from the audit, not blocking the stages above but not forgotten:

- Sepolia / Hoodi endpoint records in `core/data/AppEndpointDirectory.json`
  carry `"chainName": "Ethereum"` with the testnet only in `groupTitle`, so
  `appCoreEvmRpcEndpoints` cannot find them.
  `AppStateTests.testEthereumTestNetworksExposeExpectedContextsAndEndpoints`
  fails on exactly this and is left red on purpose.
- `EVMChainContext` (Swift) covers 15 of 23 EVM mainnets. Sei, Celo, Cronos,
  opBNB, zkSync Era, Sonic, Berachain, Unichain, Ink and X Layer resolve to
  `nil`. Each needs an `expectedChainID` and `defaultRPCEndpoints`.
- `scripts/bindgen-ios.sh` and the Xcode "Build Rust Derivation Core" phase both
  regenerate `swift/generated/` and apply *different* Swift 6 patches. One
  should go.
- `registry::Chain` calls Internet Computer `"ICP"`; `core/data/chains.toml`
  calls it `"Internet Computer"`. Aligning them removes a special case in
  `Chain::from_display_name` and the id-keyed catalog lookup that works around
  it.
