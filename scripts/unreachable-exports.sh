# Exports no front end can reach.
#
# An FFI export nothing calls still costs: it is generated into the bindings,
# it has to keep compiling, and it reads as API. This lists the ones whose
# camelCase name appears nowhere in hand-written Swift or in the CLI.
#
# A call inside a `WalletServiceBridge` method counts only while that method is
# itself called. The bridge is one-line wrappers, so a wrapper nothing calls
# still names its export — which is how `wallet_private_key`, an export that
# returns a raw private key, stayed "reachable" with no caller in the app.
#
# Exits non-zero when any are found, so it can gate.
